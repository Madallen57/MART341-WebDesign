<h1> Materials Needed </h1>
<ol>
<li> <b>Esspresso Machine</b> (with a steam wand, ideally)
<li> <b>Coffee Beans</b> ( espresso roast recommended)
<li> <b> Grinder</b> (or pre-ground espresso)
<li> <b> Milk</b> (whole milk for best texture, or any preferred milk)
<li> <b> Milk Thermometer </b> (optional, but helpful for precision)
<li> <b>Small Metal Pitcher</b> (for frothing)
<li> <b> Tamp </b> (for espresso grounds
)
<li> <b> Cup or Mug</b>
</ol>


<h1> Instructions </h1>
<ul>
<li> <b> Step 1: Grind the Coffee Beans</b>
<ul>
<li> <b> Instructions:</b> Grind your coffee beans to a fine consistency ( similar to table salt). Use about 18-20 grams of coffee for a double shot.

<li> <b> Pro Tip: </b> Freshly ground beans make the best espresso!
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <b> Step 2: Prepare the Espresso</b>
<ul>
<li> <b> Instructions:</b> Place the grounds in the portafilter, tamp down firmly, and lock it into the espresso machine
<li><b> Pro Tip:</b> Ensure an even tamp for an even extraction. 
</ul>
<li> <b> Step 3: Brew Espresso Shot</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Instructions:</b> Start the espresso machine, brewing for about 25-30 seconds until you have a rich shot with crema on top.
<li> <b> Pro Tip:</b> Aim for a "golden brown" crema, which indicates a good extraction.
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 4: Steam the Milk:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Instructions:</b> Fill the metal pitcher halfway with milk and submerge the steam wand just below the surface, creating a whirlpool motion.
<li><b> Pro Tip: </b> Keep the milk between 140-155 degrees F ( 60-68 degrees C) for optimal texture
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b> Step 5: Texture the Milk: </b>
<ul><li> <b> Instructions: </b> As the milk heats, adjust the wand's position to create a smooth, velvety microfoam. This will give your latte a creamy mouthfeel.
<li><b> Pro Tip:</b> Listen for a slight hissing sound, which means you're adding air to the milk correctly.
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b> Step 6: Pour the Milk into the Espresso</b>
<ul><li><b>Instructions: </b> Pour the steamed milk into your espresso, starting slow and steady, raising the pitcher slightly.
<li><b>Pro Tip:</b> A stencil can help add decorative designs.
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 7: Add Finishing Touches:</b>

<ul><li><b>Instructions: </b> Optional topings like a sprinkle of cinnamon, cocoa powder, or a dash of vanilla extract can be added.
<li><b> Pro Tip:</b> A stencil can help add decorative designs.
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b> Step 8: Serve and Enjoy!</b>
<ul><li><b> Instructions:</b> Serve your latte hot, and enjoy your handcrafted creation.
<li><b> Pro Tip:</b> If your espresso machine has a cup warmer, preheat your cup for a warmer latte.
</ul>
</ul>
