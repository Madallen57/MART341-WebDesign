# Assignment 10: Perfect S'mores Website

## Overview:
For this project, I created a web page titled **index.html**, focusing on how to make perfect s'mores. Here’s a summary of the techniques I applied:

### Techniques Used:
1. **External CSS**  
   I linked a `style.css` file to handle all styling, this helped the code  stay organized and made it easier to maintain.

2. **Class Selectors**  
   I used a `.highlight` class for the "Pro Tips" section to give it a unique look and make it stand out.

3. **ID Selectors**  
   The `#ingredients` and `#steps` sections each have their own styling, which make  their designs distinct and visually appealing.

4. **Background Colors**  
   Each section has its own background color to create clear distinctions between the different sections and made the content easier to read.

5. **Text Alignment**  
   I centered the text in the header and footer to create a balanced, cohesive design.

6. **Borders**  
   Different border styles—solid and dashed—were added to sections for a unique and fun look.
