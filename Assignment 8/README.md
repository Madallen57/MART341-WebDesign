<h1> Things I did for assignment 8:</h1>
<li>
I replaced all the photos with ones from the site provided.
<li>I renamed the pictures so it was easier for me to find them and use them.
<li>I added a services page instead of putting it on the home page.
<li> I added an audio file so you can listen to music while going on the site and if you needed to clean you can listen to that music.
