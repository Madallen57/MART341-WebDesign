    -Menu Page: this shows all the drinks and food the coffee shop offers
    -About Page: This tells the story of the coffee shop
    -Contact Page: this has a form to get in touch with the coffee shop
Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

##  I tried to design the website to look good on different devices ##
    - Desktop view: the navifation bar is horizontal, and the layout is wide
    -Tablet View: Navigation becomes verticle to fit the smaller screen
    -Mobile View: The navigation changes to a hamburger menu and the content makes it easy to read on smaller screens.

Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices.
