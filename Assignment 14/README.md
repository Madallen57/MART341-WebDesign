1. 3+ pages- Multiple pages with a common theme
    - I created three pages ( index.html ) (commands.html) and (about.html)
    - This makes the websites more organized the content and makes it easier for the users to navigate through all the info.

2. Framework Integration- Bootstrap
    - I used bootstrap by linking it through a CDN. it helps with design and layout.
    - I used components like a navigation bar, buttons, and grids
    - Bootstraps make it easier to create a clean, design that looks good on all devices withough a lot of effort.

3. Framework Styling Elements- Predefined Bootstrap Styles
    - I used text-center to center the content, I used btn-primary for the styled buttons, and img-fluid for responsive images
    - On the commands page I used a grid layout to display the images and text neatly
    - I did this because the styles save time, ensure the design is consistent, and make the website look professional

4. HTML5 Canvas- Custom Graphics
    - I added a <canvas> element on the home page and used JavaScript to draw a paw print
    - This showed creativity and made the website fun and interactive.

5. JavaScript Functionality- Interactivity
    - JavaScript was used to draw the paw print on the canvas and to add a button that shows a fun alert message when its clicked
    - JavaScript makes the site interactive and engaging. The button adds a playful element, and the paw print shows technical skills.
