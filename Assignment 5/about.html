<h1> Why I chose these website ideas</h1>

<h2>Small Business Website</h2>

<p>I chose the small business website for one of the websites I want to design because I want to start a small cleaning business. It would be great to have a website to go along with that. It would also be nice if it looked <b>professional</b></p>

<h2>Travel Journal</h2>

<p>I chose Travel Journal for one of the websites I want to design because I want to travel and I'd love to keep a digital copy of everything I did. I want it to be able to show all my photos and memories from each place. I'd love it if it was just <b>playful</b> because I just wanna be able to throw everything in there just like a journal.</p>

<h2>Personal Blog</h2>

<p>I chose the personal blog for one of the websites I want to design because I want to be able to give people advice about certain things. I've had a lot of experiences and I'd like to share them to help others. I'd like it if this website was also <b>playful</b> but also <b>calming</b> because I want it to be more words tahn pictures like the travel journal.</p>
