<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<h2>Small Business Website</h2>

<p>I chose small business website for the first website design I want to possibly pursue. I would like this small business website to have a <b>professional</b>look to it, that way people will think the business is legit and pursue it forward. I think the small business I'd choose to make this website for would be a cleaning business.</p>

<h2>Travel Journal</h2>

<p>I chose a travel journal for my second possible website that I want to design. This travel journal would be very <b>playful</b> and full of pictures. I think the colors would be kind of all over the place, basically because it would be for me. </p>

<h2>Personal Blog</h2>

<p>I chose the Personal Blog for the third website that I would possibly be designing. This would also kind of be a <b>playful</b> theme  and kind of <b>calming</b> less pictures than the travel journal and more words. I think this would be a blog about me giving advice to people.</p>
